Summary
-------

This is a rewrite of [my original Firebase rendition](https://github.com/markoshust/tessel-nfl/tree/firebase), to instead look at the twitter handle [@NFL_LiveUpdate](https://twitter.com/NFL_LiveUpdate). The script to run that worker to populate Firebase is at [markoshust/firebase-nfl-live-update](https://github.com/markoshust/firebase-nfl-liveupdate), and the Twitter handle is a bot that listens on that Firebase, and it's source code is at [markoshust/twitter-nfl-liveupdate](https://github.com/markoshust/twitter-nfl-liveupdate).
